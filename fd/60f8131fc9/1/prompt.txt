So we have set up this tool, you know, Entire, and it just doesn't seem to work. Like, I just don't really get it. It seems like it says it's set up, but then the clawed hooks are not running. When I start clawed, it says, "Powered by Entire, this conversation will be linked to your next commit." Then I ask clawed, "Make a commit and push," and I did it, and there's nothing happening.

But shouldn't we set this up in the hooks in the repo itself?

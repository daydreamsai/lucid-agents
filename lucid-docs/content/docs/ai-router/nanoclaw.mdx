[NanoClaw](https://github.com/daydreamsai/nanoclaw) is a minimal Node.js personal AI assistant built on the Claude Agent SDK. It runs agents in isolated Linux containers (Apple Container on macOS, Docker elsewhere), supports WhatsApp I/O, scheduled tasks, and Agent Swarms. It's designed to be small enough to understand and fork — customization means modifying code, not configuration files.

## Prerequisites

- macOS or Linux
- Node.js 20+
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download)
- [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container) (macOS) or [Docker](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daydreamsai/nanoclaw.git
cd nanoclaw
claude
```

Then run `/setup` inside Claude Code. The setup skill handles dependencies, authentication, container setup, and service configuration.

## Architecture

```
WhatsApp (baileys) → SQLite → Polling loop → Container (Claude Agent SDK) → Response
```

Single Node.js process. Agents execute in isolated Linux containers with mounted directories. Per-group message queue with concurrency control. IPC via filesystem.

## x402 Router integration

NanoClaw runs on the Claude Agent SDK. To route inference through the x402 Router, configure the provider endpoint in your environment before running the setup:

```bash
X402_ROUTER_URL=https://ai.xgate.run/v1
X402_PERMIT_CAP=5.00    # session spend cap in USDC
```

Or ask Claude Code to wire it up:

```
"Configure NanoClaw to use the x402 Router at https://ai.xgate.run/v1 with a $5 permit cap"
```

## Usage

Once set up, interact via your configured channel using the trigger word (default `@Andy`):

```
@Andy send me a morning briefing every weekday at 9am
@Andy review the git history each Friday and update the README if there's drift
@Andy compile AI news from Hacker News every Monday morning
```

## Customization

There are no configuration files. Modify behavior by asking Claude Code:

```
"Change the trigger word to @Nova"
"Make responses shorter and more direct"
"Store conversation summaries weekly"
```

Or run `/customize` for guided changes. The codebase is small enough that Claude can safely modify it.

## Skills

NanoClaw uses a skills system for extensions. Run skills to add capabilities without adding them to the base codebase:

```bash
/add-gmail          # Gmail integration
/add-telegram       # Telegram channel
/add-discord        # Discord channel
```

## Key files

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `src/index.ts` | Orchestrator: state, message loop, agent invocation |
| `src/channels/whatsapp.ts` | WhatsApp connection and send/receive |
| `src/container-runner.ts` | Spawns streaming agent containers |
| `src/task-scheduler.ts` | Scheduled task runner |
| `src/db.ts` | SQLite operations |
| `groups/*/CLAUDE.md` | Per-group memory |

## Data handling

The router does not store prompts or responses. NanoClaw stores conversation data locally in SQLite. Agents only access explicitly mounted directories — no host filesystem access outside of those mounts.

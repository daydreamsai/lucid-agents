<Callout type="warn">
  NanoClaw integration is coming soon. This page will be updated when the integration is available.
</Callout>

NanoClaw will support the same x402 permit flow as the other integrations: sign a permit, attach the `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header, and stream provider responses through the router with asynchronous settlement.

## What to expect

- Native `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` permit support
- `X-Upto-Session` session tracking
- Same OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`https://ai.xgate.run/v1`)
- Conservative-by-default spend caps

## In the meantime

Start with the [OpenCode integration](./opencode) to get familiar with the x402 Router flow. The same permit signing and header patterns will apply to NanoClaw when it ships.

description: Configure OpenClaw to call x402 Router using permit-backed payment headers.

OpenClaw can use the same x402 Router flow: sign permit, send `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`, stream provider response, and settle asynchronously.

## Integration model

1. Configure OpenClaw to use an OpenAI-compatible base URL (`https://ai.xgate.run/v1`).
2. Ensure each request includes a valid `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` permit payload.
3. Track `X-Upto-Session` to reuse session spend caps across requests.

## Required headers

- `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`
- `X-Upto-Session` (recommended for multi-request sessions)

## Controls

- `X402_ROUTER_URL` for router endpoint overrides.
- `X402_PERMIT_CAP` for session spend caps.

## Security baseline

- Use a dedicated wallet.
- Start with low USDC caps.
- Rotate keys and environment secrets on a regular schedule.

## Data handling

The router does not store prompts or responses. Payload retention is determined by your selected upstream provider.

## Next step

If you already use OpenCode, start with [OpenCode integration](./opencode) to validate router connectivity, then mirror the same request/header pattern in OpenClaw.

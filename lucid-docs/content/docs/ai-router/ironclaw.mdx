IronClaw can use the x402 Router flow: sign a permit, send a `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header, stream the provider response, and settle asynchronously via the facilitator.

<Callout type="info">
  Full IronClaw integration details coming soon. The pattern below mirrors the [OpenCode integration](./opencode) — same headers, same router endpoint.
</Callout>

## Integration model

1. Configure IronClaw to use the OpenAI-compatible base URL (`https://ai.xgate.run/v1`).
2. Ensure each request includes a valid `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` permit payload.
3. Track `X-Upto-Session` to reuse a session spend cap across multiple requests.

## Required headers

| Header | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` | Signed ERC-2612 permit payload |
| `X-Upto-Session` | Active session ID (recommended for multi-request sessions) |

## Controls

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `X402_ROUTER_URL` | Router endpoint override |
| `X402_PERMIT_CAP` | Session spend cap in USDC |

## Security baseline

- Use a dedicated wallet.
- Start with low USDC caps.
- Rotate keys and environment secrets regularly.

## Data handling

The router does not store prompts or responses. Payload retention is determined by your selected upstream provider.

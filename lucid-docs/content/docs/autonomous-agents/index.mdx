Autonomous agents can now build their own applications by combining Lucid runtimes, skill files, and MCP tools.

This section focuses on practical flows for going from a plain-language prompt to a working application.

## What you can automate

- Scaffold agent capabilities and schemas from natural language
- Configure hosted agents with `create_lucid_agent`
- Add monetization and identity settings without manual boilerplate
- Iterate quickly by editing prompts and re-running generation
